## Priority 1: Visual Polish / Premium Feel

These are the highest-impact changes for making the site feel like a premium, trustworthy financial partner — not a template.

### 1.1 — Ditch the Stock Photography

**Issue:** The site uses generic Adobe Stock images (e.g., `AdobeStock_544890008.jpeg`, `AdobeStock_1058876100.jpeg`). These scream "template site" and undermine the personal, boutique positioning Cade is going for.
**Fix:**

- Commission a professional headshot session for Cade — even an iPhone portrait with good lighting beats stock
- Replace the hero image with a real photo of Cade working, or a styled desk/workspace shot
- If real photos aren't feasible yet, use abstract/geometric brand graphics or illustrations instead — anything that doesn't look like a stock photo search for "accountant"

### 1.2 — Hero Section Lacks Visual Hierarchy

**Issue:** The hero headline "Focus on your business, not your books" is solid copy, but the visual treatment is flat. Two equally-weighted CTAs compete for attention. The "QuickBooks ProAdvisor Certified" badge feels tacked on.
**Fix:**

- Make "Schedule Free Consultation" the dominant CTA (filled, high-contrast button) and "View Pricing & Services" a secondary ghost/text link
- Give the ProAdvisor badge a proper lockup — a small, subtle badge in the nav or footer is more credible than floating it in the hero
- Add subtle motion or a gradient background to elevate the hero beyond "text on white"

### 1.3 — Pricing Cards Need Visual Differentiation

**Issue:** On the services page, the tier cards (Essentials, Growth Strategy, Complete Support) look similar. The "Most Popular" badge on Growth Strategy is the only differentiator.
**Fix:**

- Use a distinct background color or subtle border/shadow on the recommended tier
- Scale the recommended card slightly larger or give it a raised/elevated card treatment
- Add icons to each tier to create quick visual scanning (e.g., a book icon for Essentials, a chart/rocket for Growth)
- Consider showing a comparison table below the cards for quick feature scanning

### 1.4 — Testimonials Look Generic

**Issue:** Three testimonials with names but no photos, no company context beyond a title, and no verifiable signal. These read like placeholder testimonials (they may actually be placeholders — "Sarah Mitchell, Owner, Mitchell's Landscaping" etc. return no web presence).
**Fix:**

- If these are real clients: get headshots, link to their businesses, add a specific metric ("saved 8 hours/month")
- If these are placeholders: **remove them immediately** — fake testimonials destroy credibility for a financial services business
- Even 1 real, detailed testimonial with a photo outweighs 3 generic ones
- Consider embedding a Google Reviews widget or linking to a Google Business Profile

### 1.5 — Footer is Underutilized

**Issue:** Minimal footer with just nav links. For a financial services business, the footer is prime trust real estate.
**Fix:**

- Add QuickBooks ProAdvisor badge/certification logos
- Add a brief "About Cade" blurb with photo
- Include business hours or response time expectation
- Add a "Serving businesses nationwide" tagline if applicable

### 1.6 — No Favicon / Branding Details

**Issue:** Could not verify a custom favicon or Open Graph images from the fetch. These are small details that signal professionalism.
**Fix:**

- Ensure a proper favicon is set (ideally the "M" from the logo)
- Add Open Graph meta images for social sharing (preview card when the URL is shared on LinkedIn/Slack)

### 1.7 — Sticky CTA / Floating "Schedule a Call"

**Issue:** There appear to be both a sticky footer CTA ("Schedule a Call") and a bottom-of-page CTA ("Schedule Free Consultation"). This creates CTA fatigue.
**Fix:**

- Keep the sticky CTA but make it subtle (slim bar, not a full button)
- Remove duplicate CTAs — one persistent + one per major section is enough

## Priority 2: Copywriting & Brand Voice

### 2.1 — Headline Copy is Good but Could Be Sharper

**Current:** "Focus on your business, not your books"
**Assessment:** This is actually a solid headline — clear benefit, speaks to the pain point. Minor refinements possible.
**Options to test:**

- "Your books handled. Your business unleashed." (punchier, parallel structure)
- "Stop wrestling with QuickBooks. Start growing your business." (more specific pain)
- The current one works — don't change for the sake of change

### 2.2 — Subhead is Too Long

**Current:** "Stop losing sleep over QuickBooks and cash flow headaches. We handle the financial complexity so you can get back to what you do best—growing your business and serving your customers."
**Fix:** This is two sentences doing one sentence's job. Tighten to: "We handle QuickBooks, bookkeeping, and payroll so you can get back to growing your business." Save the emotional language ("stop losing sleep") for the headline or testimonials.

### 2.3 — Service Descriptions Are Feature-Heavy

**Issue:** The service cards list what's included but don't lead with the outcome. "Monthly transaction recording, bank reconciliation, and financial reports" doesn't answer "why should I care?"
**Fix:** Lead each card with a one-line outcome statement, then list features:

- Essentials: "Always know where your money stands." → then the feature list
- Growth Strategy: "A financial co-pilot for your next stage of growth." → then features
- Complete Support: "Like having a CFO on retainer — without the salary."

### 2.4 — "Join hundreds of business owners" — Is This True?

**Issue:** The bottom CTA says "Join hundreds of business owners who've found peace of mind." If Cade is a solo practitioner or early-stage, this claim may not be credible.
**Fix:** If the number is real, make it specific ("Join 200+ business owners..."). If not, rewrite to something honest: "Let's see if we're a good fit" or "Book a free call — no pressure, no commitment."

### 2.5 — FAQ Section is Useful but Buried

**Issue:** Good FAQ content, but it sits between testimonials and the final CTA where few people will scroll to.
**Fix:**

- Move FAQ to the services page (closer to pricing where objections arise)
- Or make it a collapsible accordion that's visually compact
- Add questions that address trust/objections: "Is my financial data secure?", "What if I'm not happy with the service?"

### 2.6 — The Cleanup Special Promotion

**Issue:** "Q4 2025 Special" — it's now Q1 2026. This is stale and makes the site look unmaintained.
**Fix:** Either update the promotion copy to be current, make it evergreen ("Limited Time"), or remove the seasonal framing entirely. A stale promo is worse than no promo.

---

## Priority 3: SEO & Metadata

### 3.1 — Title Tag

**Current (from search):** "Momentum Business Solutions - QuickBooks Experts & Financial Consulting"
**Assessment:** Decent, but could be stronger for local/niche SEO.
**Recommended:** "QuickBooks Bookkeeping & Payroll Services | Momentum Business Solutions"
(Lead with what people search for, brand at end)

### 3.2 — Meta Description

**Current:** "Expert bookkeeping, payroll processing, and financial consulting for growing businesses. QuickBooks ProAdvisor certified. Serving businesses with $500K-$5M revenue."
**Assessment:** Actually pretty solid. The revenue qualifier ($500K-$5M) is smart for qualifying leads.
**Minor tweak:** Add a CTA: "...Get a free consultation today." to improve click-through.

### 3.3 — Heading Structure

**Issue:** Multiple H2s on the homepage but no clear semantic hierarchy. The cleanup service section appears on BOTH the homepage and the services page — this is duplicate content.
**Fix:**

- Keep the full cleanup details only on the services page
- On the homepage, use a brief teaser with a link to the services page
- Ensure each page has exactly one H1

### 3.4 — URL Structure & Internal Linking

**Assessment:** Clean URLs (`/services`, `/about`, `/contact`) — good. But the site is very thin — only 4-5 pages total.
**Fix:**

- Consider adding a blog/resources section with 3-5 cornerstone articles targeting search terms like "QuickBooks cleanup checklist", "when to hire a bookkeeper", "bookkeeping vs. accounting for small business"
- These pages drive organic traffic AND position Cade as an authority

### 3.5 — Local SEO

**Issue:** The phone number has a 509 area code (Eastern Washington) but there's no address, no Google Business Profile link, no structured data (LocalBusiness schema).
**Fix:**

- If Cade has a physical location or service area, add LocalBusiness structured data
- Create/optimize a Google Business Profile
- Add a service area description if fully remote ("Serving businesses across the U.S.")

### 3.6 — Image Alt Text

**Issue:** Stock images have filenames like `AdobeStock_544890008.jpeg` — almost certainly missing descriptive alt text.
**Fix:** Add proper alt text to every image. Even decorative images should have `alt=""` to pass accessibility checks.

---

## Priority 4: Performance & Optimization

### 4.1 — Image Optimization

**Issue:** Adobe Stock images are likely full-resolution JPEGs. On a site with only a few images, this is low-hanging fruit.
**Fix:**

- Convert to WebP with JPEG fallback
- Serve responsive sizes via `srcset`
- Lazy-load below-fold images
- Target < 100KB per hero image at display resolution

### 4.2 — Promotional Banner

**Issue:** The "QuickBooks Cleanup Special" banner at the top appears on every page, pushing content down and adding layout shift.
**Fix:**

- If keeping it, ensure it doesn't cause CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) — reserve space for it in the layout
- Add a dismissal cookie so it stays dismissed across pages
- Consider making it a banner that slides in after 2-3 seconds rather than being there on load

### 4.3 — Font Loading

**Issue:** Cannot fully assess without viewing source, but ensure fonts are preloaded with `<link rel="preload">` and use `font-display: swap` to prevent FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text).

### 4.4 — Caching & CDN

**Fix:** Ensure static assets have proper cache headers (1 year for hashed assets). If not already on a CDN, consider Cloudflare (free tier is fine for a site this size).

---

## Priority 5: Accessibility (WCAG)

### 5.1 — Color Contrast

**Issue:** Cannot fully assess without inspecting CSS, but promotional banners and light-colored text on images are common offenders.
**Fix:** Run the site through axe DevTools or WAVE and fix any contrast failures. Target WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).

### 5.2 — Form Labels

**Issue:** Contact form (at `/contact`) needs proper `<label>` elements associated with inputs, not just placeholder text.
**Fix:** Ensure every form field has a visible `<label>` with a `for` attribute matching the input `id`.

### 5.3 — Mobile Navigation

**Issue:** "Open main menu" / "Close menu" buttons need proper `aria-expanded` attributes and focus management.
**Fix:** Ensure the hamburger menu toggles `aria-expanded`, traps focus when open, and returns focus to the trigger when closed.

### 5.4 — Skip Navigation

**Fix:** Add a "Skip to main content" link as the first focusable element on the page.

### 5.5 — Semantic HTML

**Issue:** The definition list markup (`<dt>` / `<dd>`) used for services and FAQ is semantically appropriate — good. Verify this is actually using `<dl>` elements and not styled divs.
