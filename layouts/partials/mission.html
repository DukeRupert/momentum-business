            I started Momentum because I've been on your side of the books.

          <p class="mt-8 text-body text-gray-700">
            For seven years I ran Kagen Coffee & Crepes in Richland, Washington. I know what it's like to close out the register, reconcile the accounts, manage payroll, and still try to be present for your customers and your team. I know the feeling of staring at QuickBooks at 11 pm wondering if you categorized something wrong. And I know how much easier everything gets when your finances are clean, current, and clear.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 text-body text-gray-700">
            While running the restaurant, I went back to school — earning a degree in Accounting and Finance from Harding University and a B.S. from Western Governors University. I wanted to understand the financial side of business at a deeper level, not just survive it. That education led me to Salus Law, where I managed finances for a growing legal practice and eventually became their Director of Strategy and Finance — overseeing financial reporting, budgeting, forecasting, and strategic planning.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 text-body text-gray-700">
            Along the way, I also spent six years as a Youth and Worship Minister at Richland Church of Christ. That experience taught me something that shapes how I work today: people don't just need someone who can do the math. They need someone who listens, communicates clearly, and genuinely cares about where they're headed.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 text-body text-gray-700">
            I started Momentum Business Solutions to bring all of that together — real small business experience, formal financial training, and a commitment to helping business owners stop worrying about their books and start making confident decisions with their money.
